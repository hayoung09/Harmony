											<p>I learned the process of making furniture through the convergence course and thought English was a necessary language in the future,<br/>
												but I think it was a very useful class because you corrected my pronunciation this time.<br/>
												I think it was more fun and beneficial because the professors and other students took good care of me!</p>

											<strong>한현민</strong>
											<p>Through this convergence process, <br/>
												it was good to learn how to communicate with students from other departments and how to achieve results through group activities,<br/>
												and it was good to make various pleasant memories with team members.
											</p>
											<strong>김규원</strong>
											<p>I think it was a valuable time because I could study other parts than my major through this convergence course.</p>

											<strong>장하영</strong>
											<p>It was so nice to be able to take classes in other departments through the convergence processAnd each professor taught me<br/>
												so well that there was no time to get bored in class I've never done group activities properly, <br/>
												but I realized that each role is important If I have another chance like this, I'll want to do it again
											</p>

											<strong>임동훈</strong>
											<p>It was fascinating that the third department met while learning the convergence<br/>
												course I met other professors and friends from other departments that I didn't know,<br/>
												took classes, and formed a team to work on the project and made good results<br/>
												I think it was the most fun in my college life because I worked on a good project during the semester</p>

											<strong>박찬진</strong>
											<p>Through this design fusion course, <br/>
												it was interesting to have the opportunity to take classes in other departments, <br/>
												and it was great to work with the team members on a project with a good purpose.
